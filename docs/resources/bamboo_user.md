# Bamboo Group

Provides a Bamboo user. This can be used to create and manage Bamboo Internal Directory users.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Create a new Bamboo user
resource "bamboo_user" "usr_john_doe" {
  username = "john.doe"
  full_name = "John Doe"
  email = "john@company.com"
}

# Create a new Bamboo user, disabled with initial password
resource "bamboo_user" "usr_john_doe" {
  username = "john.doe"
  full_name = "John Doe"
  email = "john@company.com"

  password = "john1234"
  active = false
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `username` - (Required) Username, needs to be unique. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `full_name` - (Required) The full name of the user.
* `email` - (Required) The email address of the user.
* `password`- (Optional) The password to set for the user.

> User passwords are never returned by the API for security reasons. As such, it is not possible to
> 'manage' the user password using Terraform. It is however possible to store a known state for the
> password (in the form of a hash) and change the password through Terraform. If no password is provided a random,
> strong password will be generated by the API.

* `jabber_address` - (Optional) The instant messaging (IM) ID of the user.
* `active` - (Optional) The user Bamboo status (active/inactive). Defaults to `true` if not specified.
